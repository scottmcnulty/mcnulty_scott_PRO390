Yin is based on the well-known autocorrelation method with a number of
modi?cations that combine to prevent errors. The algorithm has several desirable features. Error
rates are about three times lower than the best competing methods, as evaluated over a database of
speech recorded together with a laryngograph signal. There is no upper limit on the frequency
search range, so the algorithm is suited for high-pitched voices and music. The algorithm is
relatively simple and may be implemented ef?ciently and with low latency, and it involves few
parameters that must be tuned.
