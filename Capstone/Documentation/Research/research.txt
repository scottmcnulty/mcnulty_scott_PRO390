OLD NOTES:

-Remember the goals of this project-

		1. -Sing or play a pitch and the system will give feedback on its accuracy based on its closest 			frequency.

		2. -The system presents the name of a note to the student; the student sings the note and receives 			accuracy feedback based on the correct frequency.
	
		3. -As the student varies the pitch of their note, the system provides a visual representation of pitch 		performance.
		
		4. -The system captures the student’s performance; it analyzes the performed music and displays 			accuracy feedback for the instructor and student based on closest frequency comparisons.  The 				instructor saves the session for further review.

	Only the last one involves recording and analyzing .wav files.  Moving on to real-time analysis.

Researching and using Java gui techniques - there will be a main menu and at least 5 different app views for this project.  Need to figure out how to play a nice sounding tone for user to sing/play.  Researching how to represent the notes with graphics, and make something that looks good for polish.  If finished early, need to look into making my own format for persisting a training session.
